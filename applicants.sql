Responsibilities included system creation, automation, networking, and anything related to IT. Then afterward worked as a technical support/customer service/sales rep as our main task was to provide immediate support for their device which includes networking issues. It was exciting and challenging as we were measured by customer satisfaction but at the same time given sales quotas by up-selling warranties. One time our team struggled with our main metric CSAT(customer satisfaction), I came up with a resolution by calling our customers back and this overturned everything. Our lowlights became highlights, how I did this was not just by simply calling back but by connecting to the people I\'m talking with, ensuring to them that we\'re willing to sit and spend time just to help them. After which I transferred to a printer company which I spent 4 years as technical support. We were responsible for making sure their printer is fully functional and network connected. We were introduced to support various operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, etc. Then in the same company, I transitioned to a business administrative role where I spent 2 plus years. This role offered different dimensions and fields. I was responsible to help account managers and sales reps, it involves opportunity management, forecast management, quote creation, data analysis, report creation and analysis, demo/seed request creation, product research, and comparison, as well as product recommendation. It honed my skills in the tools we\'re using (Microsoft excel, d365, Power BI). One major pain point our team experienced was keeping track of our cases and that it was aging and causing delays. We had a report in place however it\'s obvious that was not effective. I then came up with a whole different report using power BI, which highlights the tickets/cases age with details. Fair enough it did provide tremendous help as it fixed our issue after a week. \n\nI believe that we never stop learning.
